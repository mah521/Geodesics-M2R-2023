# M2R Geodesics Project by Group 42

This GitHub repo contains an implementation of gradient descent.

## Installation
Install Python3

Clone the repo.

## Usage

Run main.py

One can experiment with changing n and m (homotopy class), N (number of points used to approximate the curve), K (number of steps; higher means more accurate but will take longer to compute, and alpha - the size of each step taken.)
